# Scythe-of-Sidereal

Scythe of Sidereal is a wave-based action combat game where players control Scylix, a mysterious exorcist who wields a versatile scythe in both melee and ranged combat. Set in eerie, cursed locations like graveyards, haunted manors, and catacombs, the game challenges players to survive three increasingly difficult waves of demonic enemies. Victory rewards players with power-ups that persist through future waves, allowing for customized combat strategies.

Key Features:
- Dynamic Combat: Use Scylix's scythe to battle enemies both up close and at a distance.
- Progressive Difficulty: Waves become harder with more powerful enemies, demanding strategic adaptation.
- Haunted Environments: Fight through immersive, cursed locales, each with unique challenges.
- Power-Up System: Unlock abilities and items after each wave, enhancing gameplay.
- Art & Audio: Features a cinematic, eerie soundtrack by Berklee sound designers, inspired by Luigiâ€™s Mansion and Earthbound.
